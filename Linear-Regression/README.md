An example linear regression model

data: data1.csv is a 20x3 matrix containing randomly generated numbers
- make sure to save your csv file format as specialty .csv, the common UTF-8 will not work

goal: given X matrix of m by n, m examples and n features, and a vector y with m results,
use linear regression to find theta that best fit the given data.
