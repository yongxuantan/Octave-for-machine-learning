An example logistic regression model with regularization

data: data1.csv is a 96x3 matrix containing hourly weather at my zipcode for the past 4 days
- column 1 is temperature in F 
- column 2 is dew point in F
- column 3 indicate clear(0) or overcast/rain(1)

goal: use logistic regression model with regularization to find decision boundary that best fit the given data
regularization: prevent overfitting
